 <bold> **ENDURE THE PAIN**
```text
Pain is a common lot, they say
But oft it doth exceed our woe
As when we hurt our foot or jaw
Or when our locks doth poorly show

But pain can also make us stout, they say
It bids us to endure and strive
As when we run a mighty race or heave a mass
Or when we face our dread alive

So pain is not all vile, they say
It can be a cause of mirth as well
As when we fall on yellow fruit or waste our drink
Or when we pen a verse like this to tell
```
